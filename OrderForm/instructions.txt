Here are some keynotes:
For the Customer, lahat ng mayroong "Required Input" ay REQUIRED.
Date must be in the standard format here in the Philippines.
Supposedly, Customer ID and Order Number should be System-Generated. But since this is still a simple activity, this would not be required (since it involves an algorithm). However, you may still do this.
When inputting in "Products to Order", **Quantity **and Product Code lang imamanipulate ni User.
Once nakapili siya ng Product Code, dapat automatic na igegenerate yung Unit, Description and Unit Price (based on the product code).
Its either mano-mano kayong gagawa ng database ng Products or pwede kayo gumawa ng Product Form for adding products. [same with Customer]
Total Price = UNIT PRICE x QTY
Total = Sum of all Total Prices
